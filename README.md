# Minesweeper-Clone
My clone of minesweeper made in Java

Source folder contains 3 files, Board.java, Cell.java, and Minesweeper.java

Board.java creates and handles methods relating to the board of the game that contains cells.
Cell.java contstructs cell objects.
Minesweeper.java is the driver class and contains the main method.

There are some minor functionalities yet to be implemented, such as the timer and replayability without closing the program. However it fully works like minesweeper would.
